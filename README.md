# DSA-Lab

This repository contains the implementation and solutions for **Labs** of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course at **NUST**.

## Contents
### Lab2
- **hello.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Prints a welcome message to the console.
  - Input/Output: Outputs "Welcome to DSA Lab 2!" to the terminal.
- **salary.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Manages employee salary data with dynamic memory allocation.
  - Input/Output: Takes 20 employee salaries as input and outputs updated salaries after applying an increment formula.
- **string_reverse.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Reverses a user-provided string using dynamic memory allocation.
  - Input/Output: Accepts a string from user input and displays the reversed version of that string.
- **analyze_pointer.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Demonstrates pointer operations and memory analysis.
  - Input/Output: Creates pointers and displays their addresses and values they point to.
### Lab3
- **LinkedList.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Implements a singly linked list with various insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.
  - Input/Output: Takes user input for operations (insert/delete/display) and outputs the current state of the list or operation results.
- **queue.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Implements a queue data structure using linked nodes with enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
  - Input/Output: Accepts values to enqueue and performs queue operations, displaying the queue contents and operation results.
- **CircularLinkedList.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Implements a circular linked list with operations for insertion, deletion, and traversal in a circular structure.
  - Input/Output: Takes values for insertion/deletion operations and displays the circular list structure and operation outcomes.
